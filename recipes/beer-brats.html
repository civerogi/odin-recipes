    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beer brats are simmered with onions in beer for extra flavor, then finished up on the grill
     for a crispy, charred exterior. Place them in hot dog rolls and top them with the tender onions
     and mustard, or serve them alongside German potato salad.</p>
    <p>Recipe by Zach (www.allrecipes.com)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (12 ounce) cans beer</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>10 bratwurst</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Combine beer and onion slices in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add bratwurst, pepper 
      flakes, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.</p> </li>
      <li><p>Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p> </li>
      <li><p>Remove bratwurst to a plate. Reduce heat to low and let onions simmer until needed.</p></li>
      <li><p>Cook bratwurst on the preheated grill, turning occasionally to get char marks, until no 
      longer pink in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
      center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </p></li>
      <li><p>Serve bratwurst with onions. </p></li>
    </ol>
